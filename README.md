# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. This project was created by me as my first school project in 12th standard when I had only some knowledge in C++ and didn't have much virtual knowledge.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Players take turns to enter the number corresponding to the position where they want to place their mark (X or O).
3. The game ends when a player wins by getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled without a winner (a draw).

## Instructions

- Use the number keys (1-9) to select a cell to place your mark.
- Each cell corresponds to a number in the input matrix displayed at the beginning of each turn.
- Player 1 uses the symbol 'O', and Player 2 uses the symbol 'X'.
- The game will notify you when a player wins or if it's a draw.
- Press any key to continue after the game ends.

Enjoy playing!
